# Whoami

I'm a 24 year old student currently pursuing my master's degree in computer engineering at the University of Naples "Federico II". I've been a cybersecurity enthusiast since I started talking and developing - more or less - meaningful thoughts. I'm basically the clown of my team but sometimes I also manage to contribute.
