# Whoami

Hi there! I'm a 20-year-old computer engineering student who's passionate about cybersecurity and CTF. Currently in my second year of studies at the University of Campania "Luigi Vanvitelli," I'm constantly working on expanding my knowledge and experience in the field of computer security. On our GitHub repository or on our website, you'll find some writeup to CTF challenges in which we took part.

I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and collaborations, so feel free to reach out to me if you have any ideas or projects you'd like to share!
