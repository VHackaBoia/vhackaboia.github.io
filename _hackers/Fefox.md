# Whoami

I'm a 25 year old student of computer engineering at the University of Campania "Luigi Vanvitelli".

>"I'm personally convinced that computer science has a lot in common with physics. Both are about how the world works at a rather fundamental level. The difference, of course, is that while in physics you're supposed to figure out how the world is made up, in computer science you create the world. Within the confines of the computer, you're the creator." (Linus Torvalds)
