V:HackaBoia CTF Team was founded in 2020 by *salgio* under the name of V:Screw.

After partecipating in the national competition of Cyberchallenge 2022 it returned to rock under the leadership of a new captain (*quby*) and a new name (**it is obliviously more effective**).

The actual members met and gathered in the old-fashioned way, since we all attended the same university (**the University of Campania "Luigi Vanvitelli"**), for which we compete. Our goal is, quite simply, <del>the eternal glory</del> learning more about cybersecurity while having some fun with people having our same interests and curiosity.

<del>You see, we're not so bad after all!</del>
